    - Source language
        the language from which content is being translated

    - Target language
        the language into which content is being translated

    - Locales and locale codes
        a locale is a variation of a language as spoken in a particular localization
        in smartling, a locale is written in the form "Language (Location)". for example, "French (Canada)". a locale code is a code in the form ab-CD representing a particular locale, where 'ab; is the language code and CD is the country code. for the example, the locale code for "French(Canada)" is fr-CA. when integrating with smartling, either via connector or api, it is important to ensure that locales are mapped appropriately. this means that the target language in the smartling project should match the target languages of the connecting software.
